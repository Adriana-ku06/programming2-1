This is the first work for this unit 1. we are going to describe 
programming paradigms and how solve problems using the as a source. 


<h2>Classification of programming paradigms </h2>
<p>A [paradigm](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/paradigms) is a way of doing something (like programming), not a concrete thing (like a language). Now, it’s true that if a programming language L happens to make a particular programming paradigm P easy to express, then we often say “L is a P language” (e.g. “Haskell is a functional programming language”) but that does not mean there is any such thing as a “functional language paradigm”.</P>

Declarative
-Functional
-Dataflow
-Logic, Constraint-based.
-Template-based
-Structured

Imperative
-Von Neumann
-Interpreted (Scripting)
-Object-oriented

Identify the implementation methods of the programming paradigms:
-Interpreted Programming
-Compiled Programming
